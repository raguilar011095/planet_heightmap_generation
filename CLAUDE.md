# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

World Buildr — a browser-based procedural planet generator using Three.js and ES modules with no build step.

## Key Rule

After any code change, check whether README.md needs updating. The README documents all UI controls, features, algorithms, and project structure. If a change adds, removes, or modifies any of the following, update the README to match:

- Sliders, dropdowns, toggles, or other UI controls (names, ranges, defaults)
- User interactions (keyboard shortcuts, mouse actions, edit behaviors)
- Generation pipeline steps or algorithms
- Visual features (rendering, overlays, debug layers)
- Project file structure (new files, renamed files, removed files)
- External dependencies
